/*
byte:
    8-bit signed two's complement
    minimum value of -128
    maximum value of 127 (inclusive)

short:
    16-bit signed two's complement integer
    minimum value of -32,768
    maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive)

int:
    32-bit signed two's complement integer
    minimum value of -231
    maximum value of 231-1

    In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the int data type
    to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer:

    minimum value of 0
    maximum value of 232-1.

long:
    64-bit two's complement integer
    minimum value of -263
    maximum value of 263-1

    In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the long data type
    to represent an unsigned 64-bit long:

    minimum value of 0
    maximum value of 264-1

float:
    single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point

    Its range of values is beyond the scope of this discussion,
    but is specified in the Floating-Point Types, Formats, and
    Values section of the Java Language Specification.

double:
    double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point

    Its range of values is beyond the scope of this discussion,
    but is specified in the Floating-Point Types, Formats, and
    Values section of the Java Language Specification.

char:
    single 16-bit Unicode character
    minimum value of '\u0000' (or 0)
    maximum value of '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).

boolean:
    The boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false.
